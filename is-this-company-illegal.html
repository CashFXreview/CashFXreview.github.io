			<h1>Is this company illegal?</h1>
			<p>
				CFX is taking your money in the form of a deposit and trading with your money to make a profit. In almost every country in the world such a business is subject to regulations designed to protect the public from fraud. CFX has not registered as a financial services provider in any country. Government warnings specifically targeting CFX have been made by the financial market authorities in the countries listed below. CFX have anticipated that people will be concerned about this and their standard response is that they do not need to be registered as a financial services provider because they use registered brokers for their trading. This is simply a nonsense answer and implies that all the countries listed below do not understand their own regulations. Taking deposits from the public and using their money to trade is a regulated business and subject to registration with the appropriate authorities. CFX has not done this. Also in company information I have seen it claimed that CashFX has a team of lawyers working on registration in the United States. This contradicts their other statements that registration is not required and is an admission that they are operating without the required registration. The list of governments that have issued regulatory warnings is constantly increasing as more governments are investigating CashFX. So whether you believe that Cash FX is a legitimate investment company or a Ponzi scheme it is definitely operating illegally either way.
