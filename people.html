			<h1>Who are the people behind CashFX?</h1>
			<p>
				The below list is not comprehensive, there are hundreds of promoters and it is not possible to tell who has a stake in the company and who doesn’t. The names below represent the most high profile people who are most likely to have a stake in the business and who we can find information about.
			</p>      
			<p>
				The main owners are Huascar Lopez and Edwin Abad. At present the most high profile additional promoters are Justin Halladay, Luigi Bruni and John Kinear. Other high profile promoters include, Martin Dolan, Hazel Moore, Richard Maude.

      			<h3>
      				Here is a look at some of the histories of some of these people.
			</h3>
        <p>
      Huascar Lopez (from Dominican Republic).
			</p>
              <p>

			<br>
			<p>
      Luigi Bruni (from Dominican Republic)    
			</p>
              <p>
      Businesses previously promoted by Luigi include:

			<br>
			<p>

              <p>
      Businesses previously promoted by Justin include:
			</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
      Edwin Abad <br> It director at TraDers since 1978,  a Dominican Republic company    
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
      Faith Sloan <br> One of the early promoters of CashFX. Due to previous illegal promotions Faith was banned by the American FTC from promoting business like this but continued in violation of her settlement with the FTC. She is no longer involved. 
  			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
      Jojar Dhinsa  is the CEO of Athlone Group (Registred in Kazakhistan).
  			</p>
			<p>
      To much hype it was announced that a british billionaire had joined CashFX as a member. As his only business is in Kazakhistan it is hard to determine if he is a billionaire or not. If he is then you can be sure that he has a stake in the business and is not just a member.
  			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
      All of the founders and main promoters are career criminals with a history of promoting ponzi schemes and other scams.
