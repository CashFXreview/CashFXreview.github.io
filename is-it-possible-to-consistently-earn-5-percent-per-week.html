			<h1>Is it possible to consistently earn 5% per week?</h1>
			<p>
				This is an extremely high rate of return and is what attracts people to this business. Let’s try to put this in context. At the moment banks are offering term deposit rates of approximately 1.5 – 2% per annum. There are different investment funds available where you can get up to 10% per annum without taking huge risks. There are investment companies offering 20% per annum but this is at much higher risk. These companies will invest in start-ups or property development or similar businesses which have a potential high return but also significant risks. You can earn significantly more than this by getting involved directly in business or investment yourself, but we’re talking about a passive investment where all the trading is done for you so it’s best that we compare to similar companies. Cash FX offering 5% per week is the equivalent of 260% per annum. Compared to other financial companies or managed funds this potential return is so high that it appears to be completely ridiculous and therefore easy to dismiss as nonsense. It is true that there are some very talented investors who have earned returns like this when managing large funds for investment banks. However the higher the return the higher the risk and when people find a way to achieve extremely high returns, they also have periods of significant losses. This is acceptable to a professional investor if over the long term the gains are significantly more than the losses. Cash FX publish their daily investment gains. The gains published are slightly different every day but always very close to 1% per day. Remember that this is the equivalent of 260% per annum being a completely outrageous number compared to what other funds can achieve. And yet the 1% per day never seems to vary very much. Basically these investors never ever lose. They never make a mistake. Every single day they always win at a completely unheard of level. The company says that they have a team of experts aided by computer artificial intelligence and that is how they are able to make these gains. Also they are trading in the Forex markets which is not the usual domain of managed financial funds. There is nothing new about using computer AI, all serious traders use this. The Forex market is regarded as a particularly tough market to make a profit. This is because it is not possible to generate wealth in the Forex market. It is what they call a zero-sum situation meaning that for every dollar somebody makes somebody else loses the same amount. This does not mean that money cannot be made, it just means that it is more difficult from other markets such as shares or commodities where genuine wealth can be generated. So Cash FX is claiming to have come up with a new way of trading that generates returns that even the best most legendary traders or investors have never been able to achieve. And also they manage to do this every single day without fail, never making a single mistake. You can make up your own mind about whether or not they are actually able to do this, just think through what would actually be happening if this were true.
