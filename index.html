			<h1>Welcome to CashFX Review!</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="smalltext">
				I have decided to publish what I have found when looking into the company Cash FX. This is not normally something that I would bother to do but I have put the effort in out of respect for people who I know who are promoting this company. When somebody who I know and respect offers me the opportunity to invest my money and earn 5% per week it is easy to dismiss it as simply too good to be true. However I have put the effort into investigating what is actually going on with Cash FX and my conclusion is that there are only 2 possible options. If the claims are true then this is the proverbial money tree and path to financial freedom in a few years. The only other possible conclusion that fits with the evidence I have found is that this is a Ponzi scheme masquerading as a legitimate investment company. If the 1st option is true then you are just plain stupid to not get involved and it will change your life, and if the 2nd claim is true then by getting involved you are participating in and promoting a significant financial crime. So this is something that you had better get right. 
				My comments below are based on talking to people involved as well as reading and watching through promotional material and testimonies from enthusiastic promoters and equally enthusiastic scam watchers. I have never looked into something that had more false information posted on the internet. The false information is on both sides of the argument, with many people claiming that CashFX is a scam as a way to attract traffic to their own investment schemes, and also many positive reviews that are obviously paid advertisements pretending to be genuine reviews.
