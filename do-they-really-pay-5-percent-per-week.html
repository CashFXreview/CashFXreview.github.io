			<h1>Do they really pay 5% per week?</h1>
			<p>
				A lot of the promotional information used to gain your attention is based around the fact that you can earn 5% per week on the money that you invest. The 5% figure is not a promise, it is based on the earnings that they make as they go. However historically since this began the amount earned and paid out every week is very close to 5%.
			</p>
			<p>
				However the 5% per week figure is misleading. The way your returns are calculated is complicated and I will not go through it all right now, you can research that for yourself but I will summarise some of the key points to show that the 5% per week figure is not really true.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you deposit your money, 30% of it goes to the MLM scheme and 70% is used for trading. And then when you withdraw your money at the end there is a 20% withdrawal fee deducted. Also there is a cap on the total amount of interest that you can earn, being 200% on your trading account. So when you look at what the potential returns are you need to start with 5% of 70% (because they deduct 30% of your money on deposit), so when they show on the website that they are paying 5% per week you will actually receive 3.5%. And then once your contract has come to an end (typically 3 months) if you wish to withdraw your money they deduct a 20% withdrawal fee. This is a very strong incentive to leave your money in and reinvest it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact the 30% is that they deducted on deposit is not lost to you. Depending on which promotional material you listen to, they may tell you that this is the money that you have paid towards the Academy and you get training videos as a result. Or they will tell you that this money is used to fund the MLM scheme. This is more accurate. The person who recruited you will receive some of this money and the person who recruited them will also receive some of it. You can in fact gain additional return on the 30% by recruiting people yourself. The potential gains are much higher than 5% if you are an active recruiter.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a normal investment company were to offer a return of 5% per week, the interest would be compounded and $5000 would become $1 million in just over 2 years. If you were to put $5000 in CashFX and leave it in until it became $1 million it would take 4 â€“ 5 years. This is still an absolutely phenomenal return but it is not the 5% per week that they claim.
