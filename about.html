			<h1>About SteveyMcGuy</h1>
			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p>
				SteveyMcGuy is a passionate group of people that love games and love making games. We hope to challenge and transform the market with better, higher quality games for everyone.
			</p>
			<h2>What do we do?</h2>
			<p>
				We make games.
				Small indie games for now, but with a passion.
				We don't settle for basic run-of-the-mill games and saturate them with ads or charge exorbitant prices.
				We enjoy making special hand crafted games that are enjoyable to play.
