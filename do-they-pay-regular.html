			<h1>Do they pay regular?</h1>
			<p>
				The amount paid varies each week with daily figures published, normally very close to 1% per day, for example it might say 1.03% or 0.99% for each day and at the end of the week it will add up to approximately 5% with slight variations. Over the time of this scheme the results have not varied significantly, they are astonishingly consistent. All evidence seems to point to the fact that they pay out at the end of the week the amount that you would expect them to. There have been some delays, sometimes going for several weeks, with excuses from the company, but in the end they pay. There is a significant period of delay July-August 2021 of 5-6 weeks. The company itself has admitted to operational issues with payments causing delays. I have checked through these times when payments have been delayed, and it does seem to follow the pattern that the late payments occurred when the value of bitcoin is low and the payments are more regular when the value of bitcoin is high.

				The consistency of the payouts is used as solid evidence that this is not a scam. Promoters of cashFX provide proof that they are being paid regularly as per the profits posted on the companies website and use this information as confirmation that the naysayers wrong and that this is not a scam. This is however quite misleading. The consistency of the payout is no proof at all. A proper Ponzi scheme will pay out (see the Ponzi scheme information) regularly until the owners activate their exit strategy, or until they are exposed. So the consistency of payouts neither confirms nor denies whether or not this is a scam.
